C-tech 2nd semester final projects

## CC2
### Virtual cookies
As my CC1 Christmas card, I made a virtual cookie, that you can eat by clicking.

What I initially wanted to do is to use face-tracking, so the cookie can be eaten with opening and closing one's mouth, and with positioning one's head.
Why?
My mother and my grandmother express their love by feeding us. They love us very much, so they expect us to eat a lot. I created an edible virtual cookie to express my love without making other people fat.
#### Plan:
1. draw white background.
2. load food image.
3. implement Facetracker to track one's face using FaceOSC.

4. define what is open mouth, what is close mouth. 
open mouth > set white circle's size and position
closed mouth > draw 1 circle with above parameters over food image.

EXTRAS:
- choosing food option
- bites are not circles, but more precise random shapes.
- make it sendable to people somehow. :S 

### Stone people, fluid people
I have this theory about personalities, stone people are quite stable and are sure about their place in the world, and not too easygoing, fluid people are adapting and flowing around these rocks. 
I had a VJ performance about it, for which I made gifs about my friends swimming and sitting, which I really like, but they only exist in my VJ software and in some images.

I'm thinking about using these gifs, and creating a little game/simulation of this. 

#### Plan:
1. draw background.
2. import my gifs/videos.
3. if mouse click + S > create a stone-person at mouse coordinates, who stays there. 
    I also want to create a little computer generated mountain under the person made from basic shapes.
4. if mouse click + F > create a swimming person at mouse coordinates, who starts swimming in a random(?) direction.
    I want to make some waves, or tracing the movement of the swimming people. maybe with sinewaves?

I'm not a hundred person sure how this would look like, I might come up with other interaction ideas, so this concept has more space to improve.
